        <p>School is the sacred temple of knowledge. The progressive quality of any school generally depends upon the school management. Gandhi Vidyalay Shikshan Sanstha is a diligently run educational Institution, operated by a group of devoted volunteers. Maharashtra has been a birthplace of many social reformers, especially in the field of education. The primary objective of GVSSK is to uplift the level of education in rural area and with that bridge the gap between rural and urban regions. We at GVSSK, firmly believe that Knowledge is nectar and it is only through all-round development of students we build an asset for our country India.
            The founder of this institute Late. Tukaramji Motghare was himself a teacher, and would understand the need for structured education. The rural students should not be deprived of education, everyone shculd be educated empowered and established to be a contributor to society. By this noble cause and with the help of charitable people around, the founded "Gandhi VidyalayShikshanSanstha in 1956. At first, Late Shri, Tukaramji Motghare (President Late. Shri. Vistarji Kawade (Vice President), Late. Shri. Ganpat Patil KurZekar (Vice-President), Late. Shri. Motiramji Vairagade, Late. Shri. Motiramji Hatwar, Late. Shri. Dinkarrao Shabde and Late. Shri.

Analyzing the response and the devotion and determination of rural people for school education, Tukaramji Motghare decided to concrete the educational development in the remote villages in Bhandara district and impart education at multiple locations.</p>
